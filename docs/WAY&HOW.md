# Why & How

## Why

Why does the C language already have so many build tools, and this tool is needed?

This library focuses on building libraries for android/iOS
Although there are many mainstream build tools in the c language, they have not completely smoothed out the differences in builds. This library seeks a simpler way to compile them.

## How

1. Set some environment variables
1. Create lib.yaml
1. Run `compile`
